# Neos API

This application provides a several utility and testing APIs that I use for
various objects in Neos VR. 
**It is still very much a work in progress.
Everything here is subject to change without notice!**

## Features
- HTTP GET and WebSocket debug routes
- New user session list
- Global public user list
- Caching to avoid unnecessary hits against the real Neos API.

## Usage
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/zkxs/neos-api/releases/latest)
2. Run neos-api.exe from a terminal (command prompt or powershell)
3. Ctrl+C when you want to kill it. If you didn't start it from a terminal kill it with Task Manager.

## API Documentation
API documentation is available [here](doc/api.md).
