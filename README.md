# Neos API

This application provides a several utility and testing APIs that I use for various objects in Neos VR. It is still very much a work in progress.

## Features
- Simple timestamp storage. Used to measure how long I've been playing Neos and display it in my nameplate.
- System status query. WIP to get CPU/GPU/Memory usage.
- Echo websocket. Simple test websocket.
- Hello websocket. Slightly more elaborate test websocket that demonstrates applying a transform to the input.
